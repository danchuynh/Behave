The only valid user at start up is "parent" without the quotations.
Once a child is added, they will be allowed to login.

There are next to zero error checks so please follow the prompts exactly.
Also make sure to create a MODE before you try to add children or anything like that.

Program data is now saved to file behave.txt and data is reloaded on program start up.
If no file is found it starts brand new.
